            The Internet Protocol (IP) is a collection of rules for routing and
            addressing data packets so that they can transit across networks and
            reach their intended destination. Data traveling over the Internet
            is broken down into smaller units known as packets. Each packet has
            IP information attached to it, which helps routers transmit packets
            to the correct location. Every device or domain that connects to the
            Internet is given an IP address, and data arrives where it is
            required when packets are routed to the IP address allocated to
            them. Depending on whatever transport protocol is used in
            conjunction with IP, packets are treated differently after they
            arrive at their destination. TCP and UDP are the most widely used
            transport protocols.
          </p>
          <p>
            A device or domain that connects to the Internet is given an IP
            address, which is a unique identification. Each IP address is made
            up of a string of numbers and letters, such as '192.168.1.1'. Users
            can visit websites without remembering IP addresses thanks to DNS
            resolvers, which convert human-readable domain names into IP
            addresses. Each IP packet will include both the IP address of the
            device or domain delivering the packet and the IP address of the
            intended receiver, similar to how a piece of mail includes both the
            destination and return address. Before each packet of data is sent
            on its route, an IP header is added to it. This creates IP packets.
            An IP header is merely a string of bits (ones and zeros) that
            contains information about the packet, such as the transmitting and
            receiving IP addresses.

            The Internet is made up of linked big networks, each of which is in
            charge of a block of IP addresses; these large networks are referred
            to as autonomous systems (AS). Packets are routed between ASes
            depending on their destination IP addresses using a number of
            routing protocols, including BGP. Routing tables on routers specify
            which ASes packets should travel through to get to their target
            destination as fast as possible. Packets move from one AS to the
            next until they reach one that claims responsibility for the IP
            address in question. The packets are then internally routed to the
            destination by that AS.
