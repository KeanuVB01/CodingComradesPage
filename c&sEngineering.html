          <p>
            In a typical web application, two distinct codes (sub-programs) are
            executing concurrently. These are the following: Client-side code,
            which is code that resides in the browser and reacts to user input,
            as well as server-side code, which is the code that runs on the
            server and reacts to HTTP requests. A team of web developers working
            on the web application chooses what the server code will perform in
            relation to the browser code. C#, Java, JavaScript, Python and more
            languages are used to write server-side code.
          </p>

            alt="Client/server relationship"
          />
          <p>
            A server is capable of running any code that can reply to HTTP
            requests. The server-side code is in charge of generating the
            requested page as well as storing various sorts of data, such as
            user profiles and user input. The end-user is never aware of it. The
            client-side code is written using a combination of CSS, HTML, and
            JavaScript. The web browser decodes this code. Client-side code,
            unlike server-side code, may be viewed and updated by the user. It
            responds to the input of the user. The client-side code can only
            connect with the server via HTTP requests and cannot read files
            directly from the server (Banga, 2021).
