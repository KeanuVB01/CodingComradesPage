          <p class="agesP">
            In 1962, J.C.R. Licklider created the concept for a global network
            of computers. The plan for ARPANET also gets published by Lawrence
            G. Roberts. A computer network became a reality in 1969 and ARPANET
            grew.

            In 1973, Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf collaborate to develop a
            protocol to be used in linking multiple networks. This is later on
            what is now known as the TCP/IP. Robert Metcalfe develops a system
            using cables to transfer more data over a network, this was first
            known as Alto Aloha but is now known as Ethernet. Hypertext is
            suggested by Ted Nelson to be used to organize network information.
            A Unix-based system, called USENET is developed, to transfer data
            over phone lines via a dial-up connection

            In 1981, Metcalfe's company 3Com announces Ethernet products for
            personal and workstation computers, and this allowed the
            establishment of Local Area Networks. In 1982 ARPANET gets expanded
            with the addition of the PhoneNet system. Telenet is created,
            becoming the first commercial network. Different nations were able
            to communicate via emails. 1985 saw the first-ever registered
            domain, symbolics.com

            In 1990 ARPANET is decommissioned. HTML and URL is developed,
            bringing the first incarnation of the World Wide Web. In 1995
            Microsoft launches Windows 95; Yahoo, eBay, Amazon all launch; Java
            is created; Internet Explorer is also launched. In 1996
            CDA(Communications Decency Act) is passed in congress. 1998 saw the
            founding of Google. In 1999 Napster was launched and the piracy
            controversy intensified. 1999 also saw the first internet virus
