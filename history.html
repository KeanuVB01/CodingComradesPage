            The Internet is an electronic communications network that connects
            computer networks and organizational computer facilities around the
            world (Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 1986). The Internet
            is made up of technology created by a variety of people and
            organizations. Robert W. Taylor, who oversaw the creation of the
            ARPANET (an early version of the Internet), as well as Vinton Cerf
            and Robert Kahn, who created the Transmission Control
            Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) technologies, all played notable
            roles.

          <p>
            A series of memos made by J.C.R. Licklider of MIT in August 1962
            outlining his "Galactic Network" concept was the first recorded
            description of the social interactions that may be facilitated by
            networking. Starting in October 1962, Licklider was the first
            director of DARPA's computer research program. While at DARPA, he
            persuaded Ivan Sutherland, Robert Taylor, and MIT researcher
            Lawrence G. Roberts, among others, of the importance of this
            networking idea. In July 1961, MIT's Leonard Kleinrock released the
            first article on packet switching theory, followed by a book in
            1964. Kleinrock persuaded Roberts of the theoretical viability of
            utilizing packets rather than circuits for communications, which was
            a key step toward computer networking. In 1965, Roberts collaborated
            with Thomas Merrill to connect the TX-2 computer in Massachusetts to
            the Q-32 computer in California using a low-speed dial-up telephone
            connection, resulting in the world's first (though small) wide-area
            computer network. This experiment revealed that the time-shared
            computers could operate effectively together, running programs and
            obtaining data from the remote machine as needed, but that the
            circuit switched telephone system was completely unsuitable for the
            purpose. Kleinrock's belief on the importance of packet switching
            was confirmed (Leiner, B. 1997).
          </p>
          <p>
            Roberts went to DARPA in late 1966 to create the computer network
            concept, and he rapidly put together his design for the "ARPANET,"
            which he published in 1967. The Advanced Research Projects Agency
            Network (ARPANET), the precursor of the Internet, was a pioneering
            long-haul network financed by the United States Department of
            Defence. The ARPANET was created by connecting packet-switching
            computers through leased lines.

          <p>
            The ARPANET evolved into the Internet. The Internet as we know it
            now includes a fundamental technological concept known as open
            architecture networking. In this concept, any individual network
            technology may be chosen freely by a provider and configured to
            interact with other networks through a meta-level "Internetworking
            Architecture," rather than being imposed by a specific network
            architecture. In an open-architecture network, the individual
            networks may be separately designed and developed, and each may have
            its own unique interface which it may offer to users and/or other
            providers, including other Internet providers. Kahn initially
            proposed the concept of open-architecture networking shortly after
            joining DARPA in 1972.
          </p>
          <p>
            between 1985 and 1986, The National Science Foundation (NSF)
            financed the first five supercomputing centres, which were located
            at Princeton University, the University of Pittsburgh, the
            University of California, San Diego, the University of Illinois, and
            Cornell University. The NSF also supported the creation and
            management of the NSFNET, a national "backbone" network that
            connected these centres in the 1980s. The network was running at
            millions of bits per second by the late 1980s. In the late 1980s, a
            few commercial networks also emerged, which were quickly joined by
            others, and the Commercial Internet Exchange (CIX) was created to
            enable transit traffic between commercial networks that would
            otherwise be prohibited on the NSFNET backbone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Control of the Internet has since progressively transitioned from
            government stewardship to private-sector involvement, and eventually
            to private custody with government monitoring and forbearance, from
            its inception in the early 1970s.
